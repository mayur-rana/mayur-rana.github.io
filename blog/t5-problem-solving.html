                    <h5>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:<br>
                            (1) Got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
                    <h6>What was the problem?</h6>
        
                    <p>
                        I had to write a simple function ( a bit of code ) that changed the background colour.
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h6>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h6>
            
                    <p>
                        I tried going through the code and then reading the error message. There wasn't one! That's when i realised I had to call the function or invoke it for it to work!!
                    </p>

                    <h6>How did you feel throughout the process?</h6>
                    <p>
                        I felt curious as to why it wasn't working. It wasn't particularly complicated and similar to an example so I was a little worried that maybe I had underestimated the problem!
                    </p>
                    <h6>What did you learn?</h6>
                    <p>
                        It's best not to panic, look at the obvious problems such as spelling and missed brackets, etc. Looking at the error message is very good for this.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:<br>
                        (2) Solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
                    <h6>What was the problem?</h6>
                    <p>
                        I had to do a coding exercise using where I had to check for certain condtions and then give different outputs under different condtions for all the answers to the problem.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h6>
                    <p>
                        I used Pseudocode to clarify how I would tackle the problem.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How did you feel throughout the process?</h6>
                    <p>
                        I felt good that I was thinking logically about the problem and I was fairly confident that my logic was good. I just had to make sure my syntax was correct.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What did you learn?</h6>
                    <p>
                        It is good to think about how you want to solve a problem. Pseudocoding is very helpful in these cases to work out your logic. In simple cases its good to try something in slightly more complicated cases it helps to pseudocode.
                    </p>

                <div class="six columns">
                    <h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h5>
                    <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
                    <p>
                       I'm fairly confident with this and think it is very useful.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Trying something</h5>
                    <p>
                        For simple things and doing blocks of code this is very good.
            
                    </p>
                    <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
                    <p>
                        I have yet to try this properly but I think I won't have any problems. I think I've been unwittingly doing this anyway.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
                    <p>
                        It is already useful and going forward it will come in very handy.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Console.logging</h5>
                    <p>
                        I haven't used this much. I'm sure once I start doing more and more coding this will be useful.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Googling</h5>
                    <p>
                        Extremely useful with all sorts of things. Looking up what particular commands do, examples of how to use arrays,etc in any language. Makes life a lot easier. Usual go to for me.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
                    <p>
                        I'm comfortable doing this, especially if it's something very simple. I believe that you learn when you make mistakes and that making a good attempt is important for learning but sometimes with the very simple things it's better to ask for help than spending hours on trivial things.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
                    <p>
                        Same as above (asking peers). I would also ask coaches for more explanation if I thought I didn't understand something properly.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
                    <p>
                        This is something that I haven't done in a formal or deliberate way in the past but I find it extremely useful! Going forward I hope to make this a regular activity.
