                    <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
    
                    <p>
                        I think it is a great approach where the focus is not solely 
                        on coding but also on developing and encouraging positive soft 
                        skills such as empathy, kindness, mindfulness, etc. 
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        My impressions are, overall, positive. This will take a great deal
                        of time and effort and good preparation is key!
                    </p>
                    <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I see myself fitting in quite well in this type of culture.
                        Individually we will all bring different experiences and qualities
                        and going forward we help each other where we can.

                    <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h5>
                    <p>
                        No. I still expect to put in a lot of effort and work as a team!
                    </p>
                    <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I'm very excited and slightly nervous beacuse there is still some fear
                        that I won't be prepared enough by the time bootcamp starts!
