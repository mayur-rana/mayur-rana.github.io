        <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
        
        <p>
            I think it is a great approach where the focus is not solely <br>
            on coding but also on developing and encouraging positive soft <br>
            skills such as empathy, kindness, mindfulness, etc. <br>

        </p>

        <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>

        <p>
            My impressions are, overall, positive. This will take a great deal<br>
            of time and effort and good preparation is key!
        </p>
        <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>
            I see myself fitting in quite well in this type of culture.<br>
            Individually we will all bring different experiences and qualities<br>
            and going forward we help each other where we can.
        </p>
        <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <p>
            No. I still expect to put in a lot of effort and work as a team!
        </p>
        <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm very excited and slightly nervous beacuse there is still some fear<br>
            that I won't be prepared enough by the time bootcamp starts! 
        </p>
