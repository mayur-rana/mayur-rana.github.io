        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
        
        <p>
            As explained in the Udacity video, HTML is the actual structure of a building - number and types of rooms and where they are eg kitchen, bedroom, etc.<br>
            CSS can be thought of the as the interior design or decorations eg colour of carpet, walls, etc<br>
            DOM is what allows the HTML to layout its structure in a treelike manner.

        <h2>What is meant by boxifying design</h2>

        <p>
            A webpage can be thought of as a box with everything in it as smaller boxes. It's a convenient way to break down a site into boxes and study its layout.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
        <p>
           It is the way the smallest of the box layouts are structured or formatted.<br>
           It starts with the "content" in the centre, the "padding" surrounds the content. Then there is a "border" over the content and padding. Finally the "margin" is what separates the border from other borders or boxes.
