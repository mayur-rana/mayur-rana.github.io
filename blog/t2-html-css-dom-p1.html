                    <h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
        
                    <p>
                        As explained in the Udacity video, HTML is the actual structure of a building - number and types of rooms and where they are eg kitchen, bedroom, etc.
                        CSS can be thought of the as the interior design or decorations eg colour of carpet, walls, etc
                        DOM is what allows the HTML to layout its structure in a treelike manner.

                    <h5>What is meant by boxifying design</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        A webpage can be thought of as a box with everything in it as smaller boxes. It's a convenient way to break down a site into boxes and study its layout.
                    </p>

                <div class="six columns">
                    <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
                    <p>
                       It is the way the smallest of the box layouts are structured or formatted.
                       It starts with the "content" in the centre, the "padding" surrounds the content. Then there is a "border" over the content and padding. Finally the "margin" is what separates the border from other borders or boxes.
                    </p>
