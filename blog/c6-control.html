                        Getting stuck on the basics and thinking that this is just step 1 and if I can't get past this...!!!   Being certain that something should work and after repeatedly checking and correcting the minor errors such as spelling mistakes, missing comas, etc - finding that there is a gap in my understanding! Leading to a minor panic.

                    <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
                    <p>
                       I found it very useful and will try and incorporate it in my daily life. It is a great tool to not have a knee jerk reaction that you would later come to regret or to make snap judgements, especially negative ones about yourself. It incorporates the exercises we've practiced so far - breathing to calm your mind and reflecting without judgement while taking on another persons point of view. These basic mindfulness exercises are at the core of everything in this book.
