                    <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
    
                    <p>
                        It allowed me to focus on learning and following the process to learn how the Skeleton framework works and responsive sites work rather than get bogged down on producing a polished product that I'm 100% happy with.

                    <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        I thought meditation was mostly about relaxing and de-stressing. That it required a lot of training.
                    </p>
                    <h5> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                    <p>
                        That it doesn't need a lot of training. It's pretty simple to do however it does (for me anyway) require a lot of practise (simple, not easy). There are many types of meditation designed to train different faculties of the mind. <br>
                        Mindfulness specifically trains attention and meta-attention. It leads to your mind being focused and stable yet in a relaxing way.

                    <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Starting with an intention - why do you want to meditate? Everytime you start with an intention you create or reinforce a mental habbit. Regaining attention by following your breathe whenever you are distracted. Becoming aware of your attitude to yourself. Being alert and relaxed in your posture and mental state. Acknowledge and react without judging while maintaining mindfulness.

                    <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Personally, whenever I've tried meditation I think I'm doing it wrong because my mind always wanders. It was interesting to read that you should look at this like going to the gym! It is mental exercise, the more you do it the stronger your meditative muscles get. It was also amazing to find out about the science backed benefits it has not only for your mental health (anxiety,etc) but also for your immune system. It also gives us an ability to train certain things that were in the past thought of as being immutable such as attention blink.
