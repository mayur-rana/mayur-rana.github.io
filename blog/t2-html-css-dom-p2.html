                    <h5>What is grid based design?</h5>
        
                    <p>
                        Websites can be broken down into grids. These grids can be broken down further into smaller and smaller grids. Arranging these grids in a way that takes advantage of how our eyes navigate a page (from left to right, top to bottom) is called the grid pattern.
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        With different screen sizes/resolutions, responsive webpages are a very convenient way for the layout to adapt automatically to the size of the screen or browser without having to have multiple layouts for different sizes.

                <div class="six columns">
                    <h5>What is semantic structure?</h5>
                    <p>
                       It is using semantic tags in a structured way that makes it easy for humans and the computer to read, follow along and make sense of it.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h5>
                    <p>
                        I found that defining the layout by breaking the website into coloumns to be very helpful in thinkng about creating layouts.
                        Negative space is also very helpful in creating a clean looking site.
                        Overflows are also a great feature and I'm sure it will handy going forward.
