        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Websites can be broken down into grids. These grids can be broken down further into smaller and smaller grids. Arranging these grids in a way that takes advantage of how our eyes navigate a page (from left to right, top to bottom) is called the grid pattern.

        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>

        <p>
            With different screen sizes/resolutions, responsive webpages are a very convenient way for the layout to adapt automatically to the size of the screen or browser without having to have multiple layouts for different sizes.

        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
        <p>
           It is using semantic tags in a structured way that makes it easy for humans and the computer to read, follow along and make sense of it.

        <h2> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
        <p>
            I found that defining the layout by breaking the website into coloumns to be very helpful in thinkng about creating layouts.<br>
            Negative space is also very helpful in creating a clean looking site.<br>
            Overflows are also a great feature and I'm sure it will handy going forward.
