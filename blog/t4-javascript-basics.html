                    <h5> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
        
                    <p>
                        HTML is about content, CSS is about style and Javascript is about interactivity. JS tells the browser how to change in response to a click or changing the value in a form.
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        Let's take the example of flossing your teeth. You could say start flossing from the top left side back teeth. Once you complete it move up one tooth and floss again. Continue doing this while you have teeth remaining that you need flossed. Once you have completed all your top teeth, move down to the bottom left side back tooth. (Repeat process). Floss one tooth, once complete move to next tooth and so on. Once all your teeth are flossed then you are done!

                    <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                    <p>
                       We access data in arrays using numerically indexs. We use non-numeric keys to access data in objects, either the dot notation when we know the name of the property we are trying to access. Another way is using the braket notation.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                    <p>
                        A function can be thought of as a small program that does a certain task within a program. It can contain many lines of code and in the future you can call it using a single line. That's why it is important - you can call it using a single line a pass in different values and this saves you a lot of time because you don't have to repeat yourself.
