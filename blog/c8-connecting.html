                    <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
    
                    <p>
                        I tried the empathic listening which I talk about below.

                    <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        It went well I think. My friend said I managed to understand how she was feeling. Although initially I felt a bit self conscious things improved and my friend could talk at length about a subject that was important to her. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I think that this has potential but takes a bit of doing over a period of time to get the benefit. The idea of associating positivity with everyone, even people you don't get on with is a good one but does take time.

                    <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                    <p>
                        It still amazes me that simply with breathing exercises and mindfulness we can change the way we persive others and develop more empathy for people and the world in general.
