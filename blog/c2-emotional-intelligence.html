        <h2> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Possessing good Emotional intelligence is a good indicator for success and hapiness in your professional and personal life. <br>
            In the work environment it helps with good work performance, good leadership skills and the ability to create conditions for hapiness hence good team spirit. <br>
            The first step to improving our Emotional intelligence is to train our attention. <br>
            We do this by mindful meditation. With practice this gives the added benefit of remaining calm (even under stress) and clarity of thought which hopefully allows us to take better actions. <br>
            The end result is improved happiness!

        <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>

        <p>
            It was surprisingly difficult for me to keep my mind focussed! Two minutes felt a lot longer! Definitely will be practising more.
