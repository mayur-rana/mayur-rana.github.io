                        Possessing good Emotional intelligence is a good indicator for success and hapiness in your professional and personal life. 
                        In the work environment it helps with good work performance, good leadership skills and the ability to create conditions for hapiness hence good team spirit. 
                        The first step to improving our Emotional intelligence is to train our attention. 
                        We do this by mindful meditation. With practice this gives the added benefit of remaining calm (even under stress) and clarity of thought which hopefully allows us to take better actions. 
                        The end result is improved happiness!

                        It was surprisingly difficult for me to keep my mind focussed! Two minutes felt a lot longer! Definitely will be practising more. I think the benefits would be great from regular practise.
