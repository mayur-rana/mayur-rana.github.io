                    <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
    
                    <p>
                        It reinforces the fact that having a higher purpose in life (preferably altruistic) is a source of sustained happiness. Having a passion for what you do and it being good can be a source of continued motivation and joy as opposed to running after short term pleasure.

                    <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        Independence to have the freedom to live my life on my own terms, while being fair to everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what do you stand for?</h5>
                    <p>
                        To see everyone treated fairly and to do things with kindness.
                    </p>

                    <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
                    <p>
                        It was very interesting to see that you could use mindfulness to bring back and observe failings yet at the same time reframe it in a way that is more resilient emotionally and cognitively.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                    <p>
                        It is amazing that the simple exercise of mindfulness of focussing on your breath can be extended to improve your resilience and making you more optimistic, which is quality that would serve anyone well not only professionally but also in life in general.
