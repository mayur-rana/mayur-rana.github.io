        <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        
        <p>
            I tried out the Fogg method. 

        </p>

        <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>

        <p>
            I found that rather than having a big to do list or having massive goals, starting with some small<br>
            habits can be very positive to being productive and getting things that matter done.
        </p>
        <h2>what worked for you?</h2>
        <p>
            Simply getting started can be quite hard at times! I found step 3 triggering the behaviour to be a great help<br>
            In my case after everytime that I go to the bathroom (to wash my face, brush my teeth, shower, etc), I do a chunk of work<br>
            on the sprints. I also do the same after I have a meal or a snack.
        </p>
        <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p>
            I will definitely be trying out the Pomodoro Technique further.
