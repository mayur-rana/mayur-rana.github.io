                    <h5>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
    
                    <p>
                        I tried out the Fogg method. 
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>what did you find interesting?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        I found that rather than having a big to do list or having massive goals, starting with some small
                        habits can be very positive to being productive and getting things that matter done.
                    </p>
                  
                </div>

                <div class="six columns">
                    <h5>what worked for you?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Simply getting started can be quite hard at times! I found (step 3) triggering the behaviour to be a great help.
                        In my case after everytime that I go to the bathroom (to wash my face, brush my teeth, shower, etc), I do a chunk of work
                        on the sprints. I also do the same after I have a meal or a snack.
                    </p>
                    <h5>which will you experiment further with?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I will definitely be trying out the Pomodoro Technique further.
