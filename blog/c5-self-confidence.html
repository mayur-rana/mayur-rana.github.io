                    <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
        
                    <p>
                        As we learnt from earlier chapters, the practice of mindfulness allows us to train our attention which allows us to be more emotionally aware and increases our empathy towards others and to ourselves. This directly effects our self awareness, ie be more aware of our strengths and limits. Hence we have a stronger sense of our worth and capabilities.
            
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        I found the Body Scan to be very relaxing. Although I didn't fall asleep I came very close to it. Noticing the different body parts I could really notice the tension that is present in certain areas such the back of my neck and shoulders!

                    <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
                    <p>
                       I definitely generalise that I am what I feel! I liked the analogy that our core self is the sky and our thoughts and emotions are the clouds (which can be either beautiful or dark). It's an important distinction to make that emotions are what we feel not who we are.
