                    <p>
                        The other person thought that I was properly listening to them. Although at times she felt a little conscious. I thought that once they got into a flow and weren't distracted by questions (or were led with questions or reactions), they were able to open up and honestly talk about what they wanted to. Refraining from interefering while she was speaking and properly listening also allowed me to really understand how they were feeling about the subject of the conversation. The dipping technique came in handy.

                        When taking breaks as I walk to the kithen or go outside for a while I have tried the walking meditation exercise and I find it a great way to relax your mind. I do intend to become a bit more regular with meditation circuit training as well.

                       I find it interesting that you can extend mindfulness to everyday activities such as walking or even cleaning etc. I think it is great that you can work on yourself while doing something as mundane as doing the dishes! It also liked the authors story about giving his attention to an expensive meal. By doing that with everymeal or anything that you are doing you appreciate everything more. Once again it all comes down to actually practising consistently. You can't just understand the concepts and get the benefits.
